# Sorting Algorithm Animation in Java

## Overview

This project visualizes various sorting algorithms through animated demonstrations implemented in Java. The goal is to provide an educational tool to help understand how different sorting algorithms work and compare their efficiencies visually.

## Features

- **Interactive Animation**: See sorting algorithms in action with real-time visual updates.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Customizable Input**: Adjust the number of elements and the range of values to test different scenarios.
- **Educational Tool**: Helps in understanding the step-by-step process of sorting algorithms.
